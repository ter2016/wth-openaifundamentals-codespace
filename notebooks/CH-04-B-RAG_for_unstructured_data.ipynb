    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses have a lot of proprietary information that needs to be taken into account when answering user's questions - these cannot always be answered through the data that the GPT models have been trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we worked with structured data primarily. A lot of the time, your enterprise data is not limited to just structured formats like CSV files or SQL tables. It may also include unstructured data like PDF documents or images. In fact, your individual documents could have both unstructured and structured data built into them. Extracting information from these diverse formats in a comprehensible manner presents a challenge. Tools like Azure Form Recognizer enable the extraction of data from unstructured sources such as forms or documents. Once the data is extracted into a structured JSON format, then Cognitive Search can be utilized to consolidate the entire information from different data types into indexes, facilitating the retrieval of relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk you through a use case of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that involves working with unstructured data. The RAG approach combines various technologies to enhance the quality and relevance of generated outputs. We will leverage Azure Form Recognizer to process complex documents, utilizing the layout API to extract text and tables effectively. We will utilize Azure Cognitive Search to create an index by configuring semantic search capabilities, enabling the retrieval of relevant document pages. Additionally, embeddings will be incorporated to retrieve content that is more closely aligned with the user's question. Finally, Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT model will utilize the extracted content to generate a more meaningful answer. It is important to emphasize that this grounding process follows the RAG pattern mentioned in the previous notebook and helps eliminate inaccuracies in the generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goals for this challenge are to read through this notebook, run each code block, observe the results, and then be able to answer the questions posed in the student guide.\n"

       " 'page_text': 'The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning Brian Lester* Rami Al-Rfou Noah Constant Google Research {brianlester, rmyeid, nconstant } @google. com Abstract In this work, we explore \"prompt tuning,\" a simple yet effective mechanism for learn- ing \"soft prompts\" to condition frozen lan- guage models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through back- propagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3\\'s few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning be- comes more competitive with scale: as mod- els exceed billions of parameters, our method \"closes the gap\" and matches the strong per- formance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed \"prefix tuning\" of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that condition- ing a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient \"prompt ensembling.\" - Model Tuning Model Tuning (Multi-task) -I- Prompt Design -x- Prompt Tuning 100 90 80 arXiv:2104.08691v2 [cs.CL] 2 Sep 2021 1 Introduction With the wide success of pre-trained large lan- guage models, a range of techniques has arisen to adapt these general-purpose models to downstream tasks. ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) proposed freezing the pre-trained model and learning a task-specific weighting of its per-layer representations. How- ever, since GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the dominant adaptation tech- nique has been model tuning (or \"fine-tuning\"), where all model parameters are tuned during adap- tation, as proposed by Howard and Ruder (2018). *Work done as a Google AI Resident. 70 SuperGLUE Score 60 50 108 109 1010 1011 Model Parameters Figure 1: Standard model tuning of T5 achieves strong performance, but requires storing separate copies of the model for each end task. Our prompt tuning of T5 matches the quality of model tuning as size increases, while enabling the reuse of a single frozen model for all tasks. Our approach significantly outperforms few- shot prompt design using GPT-3. We show mean and standard deviation across 3 runs for tuning methods. More recently, Brown et al. (2020) showed that prompt design (or \"priming\") is surprisingly effec- tive at modulating a frozen GPT-3 model\\'s behavior through text prompts. Prompts are typically com- posed of a task description and/or several canonical examples. This return to \"freezing\" pre-trained models is appealing, especially as model size con- tinues to increase. Rather than requiring a separate copy of the model for each downstream task, a single generalist model can simultaneously serve many different tasks. Unfortunately, prompt-based adaptation has sev- eral key drawbacks. Task description is error-prone and requires human involvement, and the effective- ness of a prompt is limited by how much condition- ing text can fit into the model\\'s input. As a result, downstream task quality still lags far behind that of tuned models. For instance, GPT-3 175B few- shot performance on SuperGLUE is 17.5 points be-'}"

However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts. Please check out our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/automatic-prompt-engineer. arXiv:2211.01910v1 [cs.LG] 3 Nov 2022 1 INTRODUCTION The combination of scale and attention-based architectures has resulted in language models possessing an unprecedented level of generality (Kaplan et al., 2020; Vaswani et al., 2017). These so-called \"large language models\" (LLMs) have shown remarkable, often superhuman, capabilities across a diverse range of tasks, including both zero-shot and few-shot setups (Brown et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2022). With generality, however, there comes a question of control: how can we make LLMs do what we want them to do? To answer this question and steer LLMs toward desired behaviors, recent work has considered fine-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2019), in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), and several forms of prompt generation (Gao, 2021), including both differentiable tuning of soft prompts (Qin & Eisner, 2021; Lester et al., 2021) and natural language prompt engineering (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). The latter is of particular interest, as it provides a natural interface for humans to communicate with machines and may be of great relevance not only to LLMs but to other generalist models such as prompted image synthesizers (Rombach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022), for which public interest in prompt design and generation has also emerged (see Appendix A for examples). Behind this interest is the fact that plain language prompts do not always produce the desired results, even when those results are possible to produce with alternative instructions. Thus, human users must experiment with a wide range of prompts to elicit desired behaviors, as they have little knowledge of how compatible instructions are with a particular model. We can understand this by viewing LLMs as black-box computers that execute programs specified by natural language instructions: while they can execute a broad range of natural language programs, the way these programs are processed may not be intuitive for humans, and the quality of instruction can only be measured when executing these instructions on a downstream task (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021). To reduce the human effort involved in creating and validating effective instructions, we propose a novel algorithm using LLMs to generate and select instructions automatically. We call this problem * Equal contribution.

Logan IV* Yasaman Razeghi *< Taylor Shin* Eric Wallace Sameer Singh University of California, Irvine *University of California, Berkeley {tshin1, yrazeghi, rlogan, sameer } @uci.edu ericwallace@berkeley.edu Abstract The remarkable success of pretrained lan- guage models has motivated the study of what kinds of knowledge these models learn dur- ing pretraining. Reformulating tasks as fill- in-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge, however, its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suit- able prompts. To address this, we develop AUTOPROMPT, an automated method to cre- ate prompts for a diverse set of tasks, based on a gradient-guided search. Using AUTO- PROMPT, we show that masked language mod- els (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural lan- guage inference without additional parame- ters or finetuning, sometimes achieving per- formance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowl- edge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark, and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that au- tomatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods, and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable, potentially a re- placement for finetuning. arXiv:2010.15980v2 [cs.CL] 7 Nov 2020 1 Introduction Pretrained language models (LMs) have had ex- ceptional success when adapted to downstream tasks via finetuning (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Although it is clear that pretrain- ing improves accuracy, it is difficult to determine whether the knowledge that finetuned LMs contain is learned during the pretraining or the finetuning * First three authors contributed equally. process. How can we directly evaluate the knowl- edge present in pretrained LMs, be it linguistic, factual, commonsense, or task-specific? Numerous techniques have been proposed to elicit such knowledge by analyzing pretrained LMs\\' internal representations. A common strategy is to use probing classifiers-shallow classifiers that predict certain attributes using an LMs\\' representa- tions as features (Conneau et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). However, probing classifiers require ad- ditional learned parameters and are thus suscep- tible to false positives; high probing accuracy is not a sufficient condition to conclude that an LM contains a certain piece of knowledge (Hewitt and Liang, 2019; Voita and Titov, 2020). Attention visualization, another common technique, has a similar failure mode: attention scores may be corre- lated with, but not caused by the underlying target knowledge, leading to criticism against their use as explanations (Jain and Wallace, 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). Both probing and attention visu- alizations also struggle to evaluate knowledge that cannot be represented as simple token- or sequence- level classification tasks. A more direct approach for eliciting knowledge from these models, since they are language models after all, is prompting, i.e. converting tasks into a language model format. For example, Radford et al. (2019) frame summarization as a language modeling task by appending \"TL;DR:\" to the end of an article and then generating from an LM. Sim- ilarly, Petroni et al. (2019) manually reformulate a knowledge base completion task as a cloze test (i.e., a fill-in-the-blank problem). Compared to existing model analysis methods, prompting is non- invasive: it does not introduce large amounts of additional parameters or require direct inspection of a model\\'s representations. Thus prompting pro- 1', 'Original Input xinp a real joy. AUTOPROMPT Xprompt a real joy. atmosphere alot dialogue Clone totally [MASK]. Trigger Tokens Œtrig atmosphere, alot, dialogue, Clone ...

Each input, «inp, is placed into a natural language prompt, «prompt, which contains a single [MASK] token. The prompt is created using a template, A, which combines the original input with a set of trigger tokens, «trig. The trigger tokens are shared across all inputs and determined using a gradient-based search (Section 2.2). Probabilities for each class label, y, are then obtained by marginalizing the MLM predictions, p([MASK]|@prompt), over sets of automatically detected label tokens (Section 2.3). vides a lower bound on what the model \"knows\", and is therefore a more useful analysis tool. How- ever, prompting unfortunately requires manually crafting the context to feed into the model. Not only is this time consuming and non-intuitive for many tasks (e.g., textual entailment), more impor- tantly, models are highly sensitive to this context: improperly-constructed contexts cause artificially low performance (Jiang et al., 2020). Overcoming the need to manually specify prompts would make prompting a more widely useful analysis tool. In this paper, we introduce AUTOPROMPT-an automated method for generating prompts for any task, illustrated in Figure 1. Given a task, e.g., sen- timent analysis, AUTOPROMPT creates a prompt by combining the original task inputs (e.g. reviews) with a collection of trigger tokens according to a template. The same set of trigger tokens is used for all inputs, and is learned using a variant of the gradient-based search strategy proposed in Wallace et al. (2019). The LM predictions for the prompt are converted to class probabilities by marginal- izing over a set of associated label tokens, which can either be learned or specified ahead of time, enabling the LM to be evaluated the same as one would any other classifier. We validate the effectiveness of AUTOPROMPT in numerous experiments. First, we use AUTO- PROMPT to construct prompts that test pretrained masked language models (MLMs) on sentiment analysis and natural language inference (NLI). Our tests reveal that, without any finetuning, MLMs perform well on both of these tasks-a properly- prompted RoBERTa achieves 91% accuracy on SST-2 (better than a finetuned ELMo model (Pe- ters et al., 2018)), and 69% accuracy on a bal- anced variant of the SICK-E dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). Next, we apply AUTOPROMPT to the fact re- trieval tasks of LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), where we are able to construct prompts that more effec- tively elicit MLM\\'s factual knowledge than exist- ing prompts generated using manual and corpus- mining methods. Concretely, we achieve 43.3% precision-at-1, compared to the current best single- prompt result of 34.1% (Jiang et al., 2020). We also introduce a variant of this task, similar to rela- tion extraction (RE), that tests whether MLMs can extract knowledge from a given piece of text. We show that MLMs can actually outperform existing RE models when context sentences with real facts are provided, however, they struggle when context sentences are artificially falsified. Finally, although the goal of AUTOPROMPT is to analyze models, we find that it provides certain practical advantages over finetuning. First, AU- TOPROMPT achieves higher average- and worst- case accuracy than finetuning in low-data regimes. Moreover, unlike finetuning, prompting LMs does not require large amounts of disk space to store model checkpoints; once a prompt is found, it can be used on off-the-shelf pretrained LMs. This is beneficial when serving models for multiple tasks. 2 Overview of AUTOPROMPT A natural way to elicit knowledge from pretrained LMs is to pose tasks as fill-in-the-blank problems.']```\n",

      "Prompt tuning is a mechanism for learning \"soft prompts\" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned) as models exceed billions of parameters. This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Prompt tuning only requires storing a small task-specific prompt for each task, and enables mixed-task inference using the original pre-trained model.\n"
